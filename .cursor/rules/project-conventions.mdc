# Project Conventions

## Package Manager

Always use `npm` as the package manager.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Response Format

After applying changes, respond with a brief bullet list explaining **why** each change was made (intent, reasoning, architectural impact) — not **how** (which lines changed, what code was added/removed). Keep it concise. Skip detailed explanations unless explicitly asked.

## Code Analysis

Before designing or implementing any request, analyze the codebase for similar implementations and take inspiration from good patterns.

## Verify Function Existence

Always verify that a function or method actually exists before using it — even if the user suggests it by name. Users can misremember names (e.g. `Object.fromPairs` doesn't exist — it's `Object.fromEntries`). **Trust but verify.**

## Code Comments Policy

1. ABSOLUTELY do not add comments under any circumstance.
2. Do not remove existing comments in code.
